# Assignment 6

Our project does not include any dependencies in order for the project to run.

## Description:

Our project is inspired by a Buzzfeed quiz format with the goal of providing suggestions to the user on potential study spaces to explore around New Haven. The user answers a series of questions about their preferences in a study space such as noise level, distance, and other characteristics. Their answers are then stored and compared with data in our study spaces database to filter a set of resulting study spaces for the user to try out. 

## Constraints: 

There are no constraints in our deployment environment.

I worked on implementing the cursor functionality across all of the different pages, along with connecting EJ's work on the page navigation into the code. This involved adding the JS on top of the CSS and HTML of my group members such that I didn't have to regenerate it all in JS. I also worked with Josephine on incorporating the graphic and UX design changes to make the app more visually appealing. She instructed me on how to change the visuals of each one of the pages (particularly the results page), and I implemented it in the codee (changing fonts, colors, sizes, removing borders, centering text, etc.)

The code includes a README text file that explains how to install any dependencies and run the project (2 pts), provides a brief description of the project and what tasks the installation addresses (1 pts), indicates explicitly if there are any constraints from the deployment environment (0.5 pts), and includes a collaboration record that specifies what each team member contributed to the prototype (1.5 pts).
