# Assignment 6

Our project does not include any dependencies in order for the project to run.

&nbsp;

## Description:

Our project is inspired by a Buzzfeed quiz format with the goal of providing suggestions to the user on potential study spaces to explore around New Haven. The user answers a series of questions about their preferences in a study space such as noise level, distance, and other characteristics. Their answers are then stored and compared with data in our study spaces database to filter a set of resulting study spaces for the user to try out. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Tasks Completed:

1. Currently, the system addresses the task of identifying the key interest metrics of a given study space and displaying them to users. This includes noise level, crowdedness, and distance. This is done on the results page and is displayed in a consistent manner for all spaces to provide comparison capabilities. 
2. We are also visualizing the study spaces with pictures to give users an aesthetic preview of a given study space that they may want to visit. This is also done for all spaces which allows for comparison between them before a final decision is made. This was a task we have assigned previously and in this iteration it is accomplished.

## Constraints: 

There are no constraints in our deployment environment.It is vanilla JS, HTML/CSS and should be able to run on all browsers without an issue.

## Collaboration Record

**Student Name and NetID:** Josephine Shin, jys24\
**Contribution:**\
To play to our strengths, I focused more on the UI and the overall coherency in the design of the project across our three components that we worked on for Assignment 5. I worked with Jeffrey and EJ on their respective parts to make the display look uniform and compiled images for our study space database. I also looked out for any heuristic violations that we had learned about a few weeks ago and added clear instructions to the results page to go into a specified study space for more details about hours and address. I made the README doc and formatted accordingly. 

**Student Name and NetID:** Jeffrey Yu, jcy29\
**Contribution:** \
I worked on implementing the cursor functionality across all of the different pages, along with connecting EJ's work on the page navigation into the code. This involved adding the JS on top of the CSS and HTML of my group members such that I didn't have to regenerate it all in JS. I also worked with Josephine on incorporating the graphic and UX design changes to make the app more visually appealing. She instructed me on how to change the visuals of each one of the pages (particularly the results page), and I implemented it in the codee (changing fonts, colors, sizes, removing borders, centering text, etc.) 

**Student Name and NetID:** EJ Wilford, ejw58\
**Contribution:** \
I implemented the search function for study spaces based on a user input. This was done in javascript. I also implemented cross page memory allocation using local storage and handled the refresh function utilizing this skill. Moreover, I created the google maps integration for the project on the final slide, and also worked on connecting all slides togehter. This was mostly JS work, as I let Josephine handle the CSS/aesthetic portion of my pages and Jeffery to handle the cursor integration. I also was responsible for handling task review.\

-----Rubric------\
The code includes a README text file that explains how to install any dependencies and run the project (2 pts), provides a brief description of the project and what tasks the installation addresses (1 pts), indicates explicitly if there are any constraints from the deployment environment (0.5 pts), and includes a collaboration record that specifies what each team member contributed to the prototype (1.5 pts).
